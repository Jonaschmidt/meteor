        (document each function)
        fix most "grammatical" errors
    continue/"death" screen (WIP) that displays score
    full sprites, backdrop
    "licensing"
    readme
    create class menu; merge retry and main into this class somehow
    redefine global variables if extraneous
    keep variables in order (e.g. PLAY and QUIT)
    put imports in alphabetical order

    bonus coins
    difficulty ramp-up as time goes on
    full-screen mode
    multiple lives
